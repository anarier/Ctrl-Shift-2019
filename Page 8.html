<h1>Panther Coders</h1>
<h3>This is Our Page For The Outreach Program For Soccer (TOPS)</h3>

<p>The TOPS organization is aimed to give every child and youth with a mental 
or physical disability an opportunity to learn and 
play soccer in a fun, judgement free environment. Disabled children and youth of a 
large range of different ages show up to help improve their skill at soccer, and 
the skills of those around them.</p>

<p>TOPS holds sessions at multiple local soccer clubs, in which those from the community can volunteer as soccer buddies. 
Soccer buddies volunteer at sessions and help disabled children and youth learn and play soccer. 
The soccer buddies are essential to the organization.</p>

<p>Some local soccer clubs that host TOPS sessions are Concord Soccer Association and DE Rush.
Information for sessions can be found at each individual club's website, and at the Website for 
Delaware youth soccer below.</p>
