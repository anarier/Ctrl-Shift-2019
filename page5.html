<p><font face="Lucida Grande" color="#331a00">“Our mission is to return a sense of self, confidence and normalcy to children suffering from hair loss by utilizing donated ponytails to provide the highest quality hair prosthetics to financially disadvantaged children free of charge.”</font></p>
<p><font face="avenir" color="#331a00">Locks of Love was started in 1997, spearheaded by Madonna Coffman who not only lost her hair, but had to watch her daughter go through the same ordeal. Donations were originally stored in her garage before a local hospital donated office space.</font></p>
<p><font face="avenir" color="#331a00">Locks of Love makes hair prosthetics for financially disadvantaged children ages 21 and under who have lost their hair. Their goal is to help all children suffering from hair loss to recover and so far they have succeeded by helping thousands of children. They also do more than produce prosthetic hair. They host summer camps to bring together children struggling with hair loss. One parent wrote back to Locks of Love saying,</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande" color="#331a00">“Lol camp had an extraordinary impact on her self-esteem  and her outlook for her future. You can’t imagine the positive change we have seen in her. I also want to thank you for bringing these girls who’ve walked the same path of hair loss together. Baylee now knows she is not alone and has made lasting friendships.”</font></p>
<p><font face="avenir" color="#331a00">In 2018, the Locks of Love summer camp celebrated its tenth anniversary and plans to continue in 2019. Besides their summer camp, Locks of Love supports Alopecia research. A majority of the children that they help suffer from Alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease which causes hair follicles to shut down and can result in not only loss of scalpel hair, but also eyelashes and eyebrows. In 2015, they provided $500,000 Columbia University for their Alopecia research. By supporting research, they’re hoping to find an even better solution to hair loss.</p>
